                    Mercedes' revival of their Formula 1 tradition through the creation of a works team 
                    for the 2010 championship was also the platform for a meteoric rise up the Grand Prix order. 
                    Already the team had generated huge excitement by securing the sensational return of Michael Schumacher, 
                    but headlines began to follow on track: three podiums came in their debut season, all via Nico Rosberg - who 
                    then claimed a breakthrough pole/victory double at China in 2012. 
                    The following season he would be paired with Lewis 
                    Hamilton, with the duo going on to stage some epic title 
                    battles as Mercedes swept all before them to become one of the most dominant forces of the modern F1

                    F2 went into decline with the arrival of the 2.5 L F1 in 1954 (with small-capacity sports car racing becoming 
                    particularly popular), but a new Formula Two was introduced for 1957, for 1.5 L cars. This became dominated by rear-
                    engined Coopers drawing on their Formula 3 and 
                    'Bobtail' sports car, with Porsches based on their RSK sports cars enjoying some success. Ferrari originally developed 
                    their 'Sharknose' Dino 156 as a Formula Two car, while still racing front-engined Grand Prix cars. The dominant engine 
                    of this formula was the Coventry Climax FPF four-cylinder, with the rare Borgward sixteen-valve unit enjoying some success.

                    A slightly enlarged version of the F2 Cooper won the first two Formula One Grands Prix in 1958, marking the beginning of 
                    the rear-engined era in Formula One. The 1.5 L formula was short-lived, with Formula Junior effectively replacing first Formula
                     Three and then Formula Two until 1963â€”but the 1961 1.5 L Formula One was effectively a continuation of this Formula Two.
